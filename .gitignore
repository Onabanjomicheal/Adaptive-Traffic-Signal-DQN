# SUMO GENERATED OUTPUT FILES AND TEMPORARY DATA (COMPREHENSIVE IGNORE LIST)
# These files are typically generated during a simulation run and should NOT be version controlled.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# General XML output patterns (ensure they catch common SUMO outputs)
*.xml               # Ignores ALL .xml by default (will be overridden by ! below for inputs)
*.xml.gz            # Ignores ALL .xml.gz by default (will be overridden for osm.net.xml.gz)

# Specific SUMO output/temporary file types and patterns observed in your original folder
*.trips             # e.g., osm.bus.trips, osm.passenger.trips, osm.truck.trips (these are output trip data)
*.rou               # e.g., osm_demand.rou (raw output, no .xml extension)
*.add               # e.g., osm.add, output.add (raw output, no .xml extension)
*.netecfg           # Generated by Netedit (configuration file for network editing)
*.polycfg           # Generated by Netedit (polygon configuration file)
*.vtypes            # If this is an output (check your input version)
*.stops.add         # If this is an output (check your input version)

# --- EXPLICITLY INCLUDE (UN-IGNORE) ESSENTIAL PROJECT FILES ---
# These files MUST be in your repository for the project to run and be understood.
# The '!' reverses a previous ignore rule.

# Core Python Agent Scripts
!DQL_Agent.py
!FixedTime_Agent.py
!QLearning_Agent.py

# Project Documentation
!README.md              # Your main project Readme file (ensure it's named exactly README.md)
!.gitignore             # Good practice to include .gitignore itself

# ESSENTIAL SUMO INPUT FILES (BASED ON YOUR osm.sumocfg provided earlier: osm.net.xml.gz, osm_demand.rou.xml, osm.add.xml)
!osm.sumocfg            # Your main SUMO configuration file
!osm.net.xml.gz         # Your NETWORK file (as specified in sumo.cfg)
!osm_demand.rou.xml     # Your ROUTES file (as specified in sumo.cfg)
!osm.add.xml            # Your ADDITIONAL file (as specified in sumo.cfg)

# Other important SUMO files that appear in your original folder and are likely inputs:
!osm.bus.rou            # Input route file for buses (assuming this exact name, uncompressed)
!osm.passenger.rou      # Input route file for passenger vehicles
!osm.truck.rou          # Input route file for trucks
!osm.vtypes             # Input for vehicle types (assuming this exact name, uncompressed)
!osm.poly.xml           # Input for network polygons (assuming this exact name, uncompressed)
!osm.stops.add          # Input for stops (assuming this exact name, uncompressed)

# Results/Plots Folder and its contents (from your original screenshot, assuming these are the outputs you want to keep)
!/results/              # Include the 'results' folder itself
